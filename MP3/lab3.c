 * ECE 222, Fall 2016
 * MP3
 * Subject: ECE222-1,#3
 *
 * Purpose:  A template for MP3 -- you must replace this placeholder
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *  #1   The user is prompted to enter a pseudo arithmetic command.  The 
 *       input must be verified to be grammatically correct.
 *
 *  #2:  The string and character type library cannot be used under
 *       any circumstances.  You are encouraged to develop your own
 *       functions to perform any similar operations that are needed.
 *  
 *  #3   No changes to the code in main.  Your code must be placed in
 *       functions.  Additional functions are encouraged.  
 *
 * Bugs:
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * See the ECE 222 programming guide
 *
 * If your formatting is not consistent you must fix it.  You can easily
 * reformat (and automatically indent) your code using the astyle 
 * command.  In a terminal on the command line do
 *
 *     astyle --style=kr lab3.c
 *
 * See "man astyle" for different styles.  Replace "kr" with one of
 * ansi, java, gnu, linux, or google to see different options.  Or, set up 
 * your own style.

/* Parse input of the form SOS where S is a string and O is a character.
 *
 * A string S must consist of up to 12 valid symbols a-z and A-U.  
 * The operand O must be one character from: + * / ^
 * Any other characters found in the input, including spaces, are
 * grammatically incorrect and invalidate the input.
 *
 * There must be no spaces anywhere in the input, including between 
 * either SO, OS, or leading or trailing spaces.
 *
 * Input: The input string is collected using fgets.  Recall the end-of-line
 *        character is included in the input string and marks the end of
 *        the input.  This string must not be changed.
 *
 * Output: There are three outputs from this function.
 *
 *   The return value is one of NOOP, ADD, MUL, DIV, POW which are
 *      named constants.  If the input is invalid for any reason 
 *      then the output must be NOOP.  Otherwise the return value 
 *      corresponds to operand O. 
 *
 *   If the input is grammatically correct, then two strings are also 
 *   returned, one for each of the left and right operands.  If the input 
 *   in invalid the two output strings are undefined.

/* Pseudo mathematical opertions on the two operands work as follows.
 *
 * Each character is converted to an integer in the range 1...46, where a is 0,
 * b is 1, c is 2, ..., z is 25.  The operation is then performed using 
 * math on a finite field with no carries.  
 *
 * If the two input strings are not the same length, then each output character
 * beyond the length of the shorter string should be a copy of the character 
 * from the longer string but with the opposite case.
 *
 * Input: The two operand strings and the operator are assumed to be valid (and
 *        are verified as valid in the parse_input function).
 *
 * Output: The final string generated by the above rules is stored in the
 *         output string named result.  The input strings must not be 
 *         changed.
